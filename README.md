# Shortest_Route_Visualizer_for_Electric_Vehicles

Project Live Demo : https://bit.ly/3vTSaLD

## üìå Introduction

<h4> A Streamlit web-application which deals with the construction and plotting of shortest-routes
for Electric vehicles (EVs) based on different aspects of the nature of
roads such as walk,drive,bike,etc which is basically the network type of
the graph used for finding shortest paths between two points. </h4>

The term ‚Äòshortest‚Äô may have different meanings to different individuals.
For example: For a person A, he may consider the route which makes him
reach the destination in at least time as the shortest-path based on
travel-time. At the same time,for person B, there may exist a way or path by
which he may take a bit more time but he reaches the destination with the
least consumption of fuels. So, Person B can call that route the shortest-path
based on fuel consumption. The second is an example of Eco-routing.
Broadly speaking, Eco-routing is the identification of the most
energy-efficient route for a vehicle to travel between two points and is
offered as a way in which drivers can reduce fuel consumption and
consequently reduce the carbon footprint of their journeys
Similarly, some more cases are there and exist in the real world nature of the
roads and networks.

<h4>
This project is designed on the generation of shortest routes between
two points based on the travel time. </h4>

<h3> Key Features </h3>

- Integrated Google Geocoding API from Google Cloud Console to fetch the geo-spatial coordinates of the locations.
- Implemented features like selection of network type, algorithm type to use, map types to display, etc
- Hosted the project on Streamlit Share
